Your child will now have the opportunity to explore their creative side with our new art corner, get moving and grooving with our new music and dance classes, and let their imagination soar with our new storytelling sessions. We believe in providing an atmosphere that promotes a love for learning and fosters positive relationships with peers and adults. Our experienced and dedicated team of early childhood educators are excited to introduce these new activities and offer a variety of age-appropriate play-based learning experiences that are designed to stimulate your child's imagination, encourage their natural curiosity and promote their physical, social, emotional and cognitive development. Come and see for yourself how your child can thrive and have fun at our childcare center!"
