      <h2>Arts and Crafts</h2>
      <p>Children love getting creative and expressing themselves through art. Our arts and crafts activities include painting, drawing, and making collages.</p>
      
      <h2>Outdoor Play</h2>
      <p>Playing outside is great exercise and a wonderful way to develop gross motor skills. Our outdoor play area includes a jungle gym, swings, and a sand pit.</p>
      
      <h2>Story Time</h2>
      <p>Reading to children is important for language development and nurturing a love of books. We have a cozy reading nook where children can enjoy story time with their caregivers.</p>
      
      <h2>Drama</h2>
      <p>Our drama activities encourage children to explore their imaginations and work collaboratively with their peers. We have dress-up clothes, puppets, and a stage area for performances.</p>
